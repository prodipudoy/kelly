            <p class="ab_p">I felt empty, stuck and not really sure who I was for a very long time. Since the day I was born, all I knew was to tick every box my parents have planned for me. Not only did I attend school, I also had extracurricular activities - Maths tutoring, English tutoring, Chinese school, piano, tennis and swimming lessons just to name a few. Eventually I had very little desire fulfilling my parents’ such as being a doctor or a lawyer. It was tough for them and their status because I was not the trophy daughter they probably dreamt of having. </p>

        <h1 class="never_h1">I never expected that...</h1>
        <p class="never_p1">I never expected that I’d attend university let alone graduate. I obtained a science degree and thereafter landed my first full time paying corporate job that wasn’t remotely related to my studies. I thought that the commitment, energy and dedication I invested towards to my degree would be enough to satisfy my parents but it wasn’t. They somehow weren’t satisfied because in their eyes success was defined as achieving top honours in school and becoming a doctor or lawyer.
          <br>
          <br>
        For a very long time, I was numb and became immune to my parents needs and conformed to every rule they made. I didn’t know any better. When I was sad, angry, jealous and frustrated, I would brush it off because my parents rarely asked me how my day was after school or piano lessons, instead it was “was your teacher happy with you? Did you get a good mark?”</p>

         <p class="expected_p">When I started working fulltime, I braced myself whenever any of my colleagues asked about my education history. “Yes, I have a Science background and no I don’t have a background in insurance” was my usual response. Their confused looks left me feeling like an outcast. Just because I did not study anything ‘insurance related’ doesn’t meant I can’t work? It doesn’t make me belong less than anyone else? My coping mechanism was to laugh it off. That’s how I protected myself from being hurt because no one understood my story.
          <br>
          <br>
          Little did I know I was slowly embarking on my own journey. Fast forward to today, I realise now that a 9-5 is not for me. I’ve accumulated over 8 years of experience dealing with physical and mental health patients. Most importantly I’ve learned to see things from different perspective which means I can understand your pain, I’ll empathise and be relatable to you.
          <br>
          <br>
        My passion, desire and purpose have really come to fruition thanks to Covid-19. My mission is to share my personal story with the Asian community and give them hope. Hope where you can survive inter-generational Asian trauma you have been suffering from for many years. Hope where you can break free from the sticky stigma and unleash the suppressed emotions and feelings you have kept hidden away.</p>
